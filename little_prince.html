As the little prince dropped off to sleep. I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
    <txtunderline> I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</txtunderline>
  <txtbackgnd>It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</txtbackgnd> In the moonlight
    I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I
    said to myself: <txtcolor>"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."</txtcolor>
As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again:
<txtcolor>"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a
flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like
the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</txtcolor>
And I felt him to be more fragile still. <txtunderline>I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame
  might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</txtunderline>
