<h2>Short Bio for Aryanna Ferguson</h2>
<p>My name is Aryanna Ferguson. I am a senior. I am currently 20 years old. I have been coding since I was 10 years, and I also joined coding camps. </p>
<p>What made me interested in coding, was me playing video games which then resulted in me wanting to create my own! </p>
<p> In one of my coding camps, we had created a "Pac-Man" video game and copied it onto a CD.</p>
<p> My dad is a Software Engineer and I told him what I wanted to do when I was just 8 years old, and he helped me and guided me throughout my journey.</p>
<p> Honestly if it wasn't for my dad helping me by me just telling him what I wanted to do, and Jesus as well as my dad knew the path for me to take, I don't know what I would be doing right now if it wasn't for them.</p>
