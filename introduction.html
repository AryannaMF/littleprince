<h2>Introduction for Aryanna Ferguson</h2>
<p> Two pictures below can be identified as my dog and a meal that I had made.
The first picture is my puppy Princeton. I love him so much, and he is a Mini Poodle.
    He is very loving, wild, funny and just a great snuggle buddy :)</p>
<p>The next picture is a meal I had made the other night, just a "chopped cheese" and homemade potato wedges.
Cooking is definitely one of my favorite hobbies, and it's a great skill that I have.</p>
<p>I love making my food from scratch, and it's for sure one of my love languages.</p>
